        Introducing Organizational DNA (ODNA), the structure perspective has changed from the person to the Organization.
        We have developed a product that works with active directory to automate permissions and changes as they occur in organizations. it allows users to get the data and access they need without the data and access they don't. It is user friendly and requires no on-going IT intervention.
        
        What used to take weeks, takes hours, or minutes.  What used to be a very painful manual process is completely automated, and includes drag and drop capabilities for moving people, and for making large company changes such as mergers, acquisitions, and reorganizations. 
        
        What used to be a very complicated, and many times incorrect and overwhelming set of groups in AD is now, in this product a clean set of groups that are automatically changed as changes are made to the organization – on either a large or small scale.

          In this illustration each umbrella is representative of a user ID in Azure Active Directory or Active Directly. Every color group is representative of a specific company or division of an organizational structure, every sub-color group represents a department. 
          Where each person is standing is representative of their location, and each small group of umbrella’s represents an area. In AAD/AD today each group must be manually setup or completed with scripts. 
          Each different person (user ID), color (division), sub-color group (department), standing position (location), and small groups of umbrella’s (areas) would have to be created manually. 
          As the organization changes, these groups need to be reorganized, and the people manually 
          affected. 2 million and counting.  EVERY ONE must be removed, and the groups corrected.  It is 
          rarely correct or clean, even using scripts.  Billions and Billions are dollars are spent, and the result is far less than reliable.

          As the organization changes, these groups need to be reorganized, and in essence the people manually moved to
          the appropriate group(s).
          This process generally leaves organizations with a great deal of work, and full time IT staff to control the
          groups and make the changes. They can do this effectively if they get the information from management or
          operations, and in a timely manner. -->

          Ideas Matter, Passion Matters, Optimism is a force magnified, Execution and Measurement (of yourself – hold yourself accountable), realistic.  Get in the weight room (get yourself stronger, better), be Hard Core (Tenacious, bold, long term, etc.)  People will encourage you to give up on everything.  You work at things 10 – 15 years before things really emerge, remaining active on all the things above.  Decide what outcome you want (Bill Gates was offered 7.9 million for Microsoft as it was at that time – but outcome wouldn’t have been the same.) – Steve Balmer #1096 Ideas Matter
          
          We scoured the earth to find something, anything that would make AAD/AD a viable and stable product for our business and more than 360 customers and never found the solution.  <em class="blue_em">Simply stated, and with respect, AAD/AD doesn’t work in its current state and hasn’t for a very long time.  It is the one product in the stack, (and the bedrock) that hasn’t received substantial new core provisions innovation over time.  That’s a real problem.</em>
